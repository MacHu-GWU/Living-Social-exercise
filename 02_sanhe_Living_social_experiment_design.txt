• The clarity of the stated aims, hypotheses, and expected results
• The appropriate generation of your user sample
• Your test or model evaluation methods
• The extent to which you thoroughly investigate possible outcomes and conclusions

Option 2: Deal targeting

LivingSocial has customers in a number of cities. Imagine that the company is
currently ordering one of its line of services, Takeout and Delivery, in some of
these cities, and it plans to introduce the service to a few additional cities. Your
task is to come up with a predictive model to find which LivingSocial customers
in these additional cities would be interested in Takeout and Delivery.


=========================== [Sanhe's experiment design] ===============================

Notation
--------
	T&D = Takeout and Delivery Service
	LS = Living Social

Aims
----
	Target the customers that would be insterested in Takeout and Delivery Service.

Hypothese
---------
	For example: suppose LS is running T&D service in Washington DC, now LS wants to
	expand its business to Maryland. So the aim is

Expected results
----------------
	Given a customer profiler and restaurants profiles list, output the label:
		A. interested in T&D
		B. NOT interested in T&D

The model
---------
	Features as Input
	-----------------
		What features we can get in our current business
		------------------------------------------------
			1. customer name, gender
			2. customer address
			3. customer's order and price (what food they ordered and how much)
			4. customer payment method (cash, card)
			5. when does customer place the order
			6. restaurant address
			7. restaurant type
			8. how long it takes for delivery
			9. customer evaluation feedback

			Inaddition, if sign up is required, then we can also have more information
			such as how many times they ordered, their food preference, ...

		How we make use of them
		-----------------------
			1. we have customer address, then we know its a business place, or a private
			home. Combine with the time they ordered. then we may know: people on what
			situation, may need T&D service
			
			2. the distance from customer address to restaurant address. We can do this 
			by call geocoding API. Combine with the how long delivery takes, then we may
			know how long and how far it is acceptable. (for example, when I search restaurant
			on yelp, we ususally sort result by order of distance.)

			3. customer order and price. then we know its a group order or an individual order.
			Because in business intensive area, some customer order food for the whole office. 
			Then we may know for certain customer in certain area, they may do group order


			etc...


Test and model evaluation method
--------------------------------
	Statistic significant analysis
	------------------------------

	for i = 1 - n, we calculate:
		sum money (SELECT order WHERE criterion n) / total amount in certain group of customer.

	for example:
		criterion1 = people order from 11am - 2pm, individual order, restaurants distance <= 3 mile
		certain group of customer = people order from 11am - 2pm (lunch order potential customer analysis)

	we can design a group of criterion to see if we can find some interesting pattern.


	prediction model
	----------------
	Now we can first target group of people we considered as "may interested", and send invitation.
	After that we collect feedback see what they ordered, how many they don't ordered, why? (if they
	are willing to give)

	Then we can take a supervised machine learning study. Using features derived from the raw feature 1-9.
	(In section "How we can make use of them") and apply:

	linear model: 
		perceptron, logical/linear regression

	Nonlinear: 
		Decision tree, Bayesian belief network, ...


Discuss and conclusions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Business thought
		payment method incent customer to place the order. Because all customer are 
		"lazy" people. And not all restaurants have a online system to accept online order
		
		If we have a website they can put their credit card information and 
		place the order for any restaurant they name. Then LS can charge their card, 
		(plus 5% service fee) and send LS delivery guy to the restaurant and pay in cash.
		Then even the restaurant doens't even have a website, customer can still do online
		payment. Very good user experience right?

	Conclusion
		Usually
			1. People don't have time to go out for lunch & dinner. 
				(Business intensive building and office in downtown)

			2. They don't have restaurants in walking distance near by.
				(Tech industry intensive county like McLean, Germantown)

			3. Too tired to cook for dinner.
				(Takes long to get home from DC, for example people live in Vienna and work in DC)

			4. Home party order
				(weekend dinner)

			5. Loyal customer for certain restaurant
